# cyber-range
Assuming you have a licensed ESXi or vCenter instance, a linux server, and admin/root credentials to both, build out a cyber-range with Windows, Active Directory, and Linux hosts. Build as few or as many hosts as you need, create users, install software. In less than an hour. 

Optionally simulate some simple user activity on the range. 

Then delete it just as fast.
