# cyber-range
- Assuming you have a licensed ESXi or vCenter instance, a linux server, and admin/root credentials to both, build out a cyber-range with Windows, Active Directory, and Linux hosts. Build as few or as many hosts as you need, create users, install software. In less than an hour. 

- Optionally simulate some simple user activity on the range. 

- Then delete it just as fast.
